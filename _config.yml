  I'm creative freelancer working in film and photogrpahy industry. I put my first steps in web development around 2005 when playing games with my clan. Yet I was more into design and creation, so i haven't gone into coding. 

  I used to build sites on Wordpress. Now I make a step to become Front-End developer (or even a Full-Stack). I'm recently focused on mastering JavaScript, getting into React/Vue & frameworks (like Animate, AOS, NuxtJs, W3CSS).

  I currently work mostly with HTML, CSS and basics of JavaScript. I love how todays browser's technologies can deliver dynamic and animated sites.
